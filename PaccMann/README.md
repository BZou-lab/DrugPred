# PaccMann

Source code: <https://github.com/PaccMann/paccmann_predictor>.

## Platform

Python 3.9.7

## Details about each file and folder

The Python code for training, predicting, and summary results can be found in the code folder. The author of Paccmann provides instructions and examples, minor changes are adapted to fit the GDSC dataset. SMILES were scraped from PubChem, see the gdsc_old.ipynb for details. The response data were not uploaded due to size limits. 

### analysis
Contains performance evaluation statistics of the models.compact_results: contained the results for one experiment that combines results across all CV fold. The compact results can be retrieved by running the below code: "make_compact_results_PaccMann.R".
make_compact_results_PaccMann.R: to retrieve the compact results.
PaccMann_getstatistics.py: the python code to calculate the statistics shown in the paper. Please use it interactively.

### command
Includes bash scripts used for training and predicting drug response. These scripts detail the command-line instructions required to run the models. Running the training command will generate 10 paralleled training processes and automatically save the best parameter in the home directory. Then run the test command to test the model performance. 

### code
Houses the original codebase for the PaccMann model. This includes all the Python scripts necessary for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

### Paccmann_result
Contains the prediction results generated by the model. This includes output files for 10 cv with predicted drug response values for the test datasets, as well as the model performance merit calculation. Three folders under this folder, which are "random", "random1" and "random2". The results of "With-Drug" experimental settings are under the folder "random1". Results of three differently shuffled "Null-Drug" settings are under each folder.


### Data
The original data are obtained from the GDSC Database at https://www.cancerrxgene.org/. Data after basic cleaning are under the folder "data", these data should be preprocessed again using code "gdsc_preprocess.ipynb" to generate the input data for PaccMann. Input data include training and testing data in 3 settings, mask cell, mask drug and mask combination. Smiles and gene expression data.

#### Addtional Data
Training, testing and validation response data; Gene expression data; SMILES for drugs. Those data can be retrieved using preprocessing code "gdsc_preprocess.ipynb".
